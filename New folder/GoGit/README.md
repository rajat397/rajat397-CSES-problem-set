## Task 4
### Step-1
- First checkout to the task4 branch and create a new branch named `PR-branch`.
- Now in your task4 branch create a new folder whose name will be your GitHub username.
- Inside this folder create a text file whose name will be `info.txt`.
- Now inside `info.txt` answer this question.</br>
 **Ques- Name the topics that you did't understand from FOSS workshops.**
- Now add your changes and then commit them with this commit message - `Commit-1`.

### Step-2
- Now, from your `task4` branch, create a new branch named `abhay`.
- In `abhay` branch, create a new text file whose name will be `abhay.txt`.
- Now inside `abhay.txt`, answer this question.</br>
 **Ques- Tom and Alexa are working on the same project say Hulk. Tom made some changes in the Hulk project and pushed the changes from his local git repository. Alexa wants to see the changes in her local git repo as well. Which of the following command she should use to get the latest version of the project?**
- Now add your changes and then commit them with this commit message - `Commit-2`.

### Step-3
- Come back to your `task4` branch and inside `info.txt` file that you created earlier in step-1, answer this question. **Ques- Explain in brief the uses of git/github.**
- Now add your changes and then commit them with this commit message - `Commit-3`.

### Step-4
- This step is a recalling step i.e. you will see that what changes you did in task4 and in which branch.
- Checkout to branch `task4` and use `git log` to see commit history. (Note that which commit is present in this branch)
- Checkout to branch `abhay` and use `git log`. (Note that which commit is present in this branch)
- Now checkout to `PR-branch` branch, the branch that you created in the very first step and use `git log`, in git log output you will find that there is no any commit present     that you did while doing this task.

### Final Step
- In this step you have to bring all the changes that you did in this task (all 3 commits) into this `PR-branch`, and just only bringing is not enough, the method of bringing should be such that there should be no any extra commits other than the 3 commits that you did in this task i.e. only `Commit-1`, `Comit-2` and `Commit-3` should be present and also the final order of the commits in this branch after the valid procedure that you used to bring the changes of other branches into `PR-branch` should be only this.

- Now finally `push all your branches` and on github create a Pull Request from your `PR-branch` to my `task4` branch. Be sure to mention the `Issue No.` in the PR.

### Note- ☠️ Don't just copy paste your changes and commit them as I want, use a valid git procedure to do this task. If found that you didn't use any valid git procedure, that may lead to a ban from any further contests.
